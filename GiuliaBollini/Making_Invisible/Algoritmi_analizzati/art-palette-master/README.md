# Art Palette

[Art Palette](https://artsexperiments.withgoogle.com/artpalette/) is part of [Arts & Culture experiments](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/arts-culture), which explore innovative
ways for users to interact with art collections. With [Art Palette](https://artsexperiments.withgoogle.com/artpalette/), you can
search for artworks that match a color combination of your choice.

# Develop

Some elements of the site are not in the repository but it gives you the base code and concepts to build your own efficient search by palette tool.

The source code is separate in two parts :

1. The frontend Javascript code used to extract the color palette from an image.
2. The backend Python code used to find the nearest palettes matching a given one with the palette embedding TensorFlow model.

## [Palette Extraction (frontend)](palette-extraction)

Javascript palette extractor that returns the palette calculated for an [ImageData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ImageData).

## [Palette Embedding (backend)](palette-embedding)

Machine learning model that returns an embedding of color palettes in an Euclidean space that preserves perceptual distance. This embedding enables efficient nearest-neighbor search.
